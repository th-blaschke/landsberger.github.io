Dear Professor,

Herewith my poor results on your last request, which I actually
completed about a week ago, but mislaid the paper.

UCP IX p. 57 no.2 (new Mus. nb. 9-2540)
line: 2 (after i-ša-al) {Keilschrift}
3 (after URU) {Keilschrift}
4 (whole line) {Keilschrift}
5 (after LÚ) {Keilschrift} (it does not look like GAL)
6 (from beginning) {Keilschrift}
8 (from beginning {Keilschrift} etc.
12 (end) {Keilschrift}

15 (from beginning) {Keilschrift} rabu-mu-še {Keilschrift}
16 (begin) {Keilschrift} a-na é i-den
17 (begin) {Keilschrift}

I must apologize for not offering any suggestions, as NB is not
my metier at all, and the best I can do is copy what I think I saw.
As for the "juicy mīšaebĕrak", I'm going on a diet as of now, and
couldn't use it anyway; I've had plenty before, but I've never managed
to be able to cash one in onesomething more substantial. But thanks
anyhow; I herewith return the offer with the suggestion that you
convert it to a special "lechayyim" on me ... but not too many at once.

Cordially yours,

Jack
