Dear Professor Landsberger,
Very many thanks indeed for your
generous gift & your books. I am indeed
glad to have them. You have produced a
great work in clearing up so much about
the animals, and I have to thank you
for treating me so generously in your
text, in quoting me so fully. Your work
will be of immense use to Assyriologists.
I fear that the few books and offprints
which I sent are, for the most part, old, and
I expect you will have had them. I hope
to have an offprint ready soon on a
"medical" tablet in CT.XIV, and soon further
translations coming out in Babyloniaca.
Again with many thanks, particularly
for treating me so well.
Yours sincerely.
R. Campbell Thompson.
