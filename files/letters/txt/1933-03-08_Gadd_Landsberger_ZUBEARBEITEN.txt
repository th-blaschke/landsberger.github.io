Dear Professor Landsberger,
Many thanks for the trouble you have taken in
answering my enquiry, and for the information you give me.
I am glad to hear that you do not consider mubarrimu
= Seiler possible, for my own suggestion would be quite
different.
As for the reading, I think there can be no doubt about
{Keilschrift}; on the tablet I have it is {Keilschrift} (as nearby as I can represent it)
and mu-ba-x is written as a group at the beginning of the line,
with a gap of about 18 mm. before the next sign. It is indeed
surprising, as you say, but I do not see any other explanation for it.
As to úr-bi-a and PA-bi-a, these are parts of a description
of (apparently) a tree: at its root a ------ serpent had its nest,
at its top Zû had put his young, and the next line is
"In its middle Lilith had 'built a house'"
šab-ba-bi ki-sikil-lìl-la-ge é im-ma-ni-ib-dú
To revert to the first line, I am inclined to translate
it
'The dyer(?) had not dyed his(?) leather with it' (-da-)
i.e. with some product of the tree, bark, leaves, etc. such as
are and always have been used. Does this seem too
outrageous to you?
Later, Gilgamesh makes his {Keilschrift} (pukku)
out of the root ({Keilschrift}) of this tree, and his {Keilschrift}
(mikku) out of its top ({Keilschrift}). But {Keilschrift} is ḪU-pa-tum
which Thureau-Dangin says (RA.XVII.28) is noix de galle.
There is something very interesting here, but I do not
at present profess to understand it, and do not wish to
be fantastic.
There is, in the recently appeared number of the B.M. Quarterly
a short general summary of the contents of this tablet: I have not,
unfortunately, any copies of my own, but if it is accessible to you
I think you might be interested: it ends with the beginning lines
of the Assyrian XII Tablet as we have it. Yours very truly,
C. J. Gadd.
