Dear Colleague,

Very many thanks for your congratulations on my 7Oth, and for the
pleasure I had in reading your critique of Rundgren, showing your complete
familiarity with the subject, your great talent, tasimtu, and--most
remarkable--your great modesty.

If my "Ã–ffentlichen Gutachten", of which R. quotes sentences out of
context (a fact without parallel in the history of Universities!), had been
requested after the appearance of R.'s second book, it would not have been
quite so negative, but it still would not have changed basically, insofar as
I am still unable to recommend him as the only representative of a chair in
Semitics, or for replacing an Assyriologist.

It is very naive--or even evil--on R.'s part, to assume that I still
stick to all the views I expressed in 1926. Of course, I was extremely "[?]
in explaining the I2, but still I was the first to say that its function is
temporal (in the broadest sense).

I have not read R.'s book because all my time is devoted to lexical
studies and their implications, viz. the history of culture. So much the more
was I interested to learn about it from you and to learn your own "aspect" of
"aspects" from your remarks. We are together in one principle point: extreme
modesty in reconstruction, and no "Urbedeutungen".

I still adhere to the Aktionsarten (Durative, etc.), but "of course" nothing
temporal is without an aspect, and the tense is nothing else than an aspect.
As to the t-form, I should publish some new observations, but this goal will
hardly be realized.

With all good regards and renewed thanks,

Very sincerely,

Benno Landsberger
